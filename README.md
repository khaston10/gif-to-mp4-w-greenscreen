# Convert gif Files to MP4 with Green Screen Added
## An application built in Python that allows the user to convert GIFs to MP4s where the transparent pixels are replaced by green pixels. 

Many applications do not support .gif files. This project will allow you to convert the file to a more widely supported file type. Since MP4s do not hold a transparent channel for pixels, all transparent pixels will be converted to a green screen color selected by the user. THis will allow green screen effects to be applied to the clip.
